Congrats, weary wanderer. You’ve found my blog, entrenched deep within the internet.

Here, my friend, you will find a snapshot of who *Ahmed Zeer* is. His past, current, and future projects are all answered at this station. You'll also find publications, awards, and talks sprinkled throughout the site—take a look, you might find something interesting. Give it a shot.  

Finally, yes we like aquatic animals and you will encounter them if you use a wide screen :)

## Index

In [Publication](@/publication/_index.md), you’ll find my academic footprint—research centered on Turkish NLP, large language models, multimodality, and dataset curation, along with links to published papers. It’s where theory, experiments, and long nights of training runs quietly live.

[Award](@/award/_index.md) documents the milestones along the way: hackathons, competitions, and moments where ideas left the lab and stood on real stages. Some trophies, some lessons, all formative.

Under [Talk](@/talk/_index.md), I step out from behind the keyboard—conference talks, live streams, and recorded sessions where I share ongoing work, failures, and the occasional hard-earned insight with others in the field.

If you’re in the mood for something slower, [Blog](@/blog/_index.md) hosts my writing—short, intentional pieces meant to be read without rush.

Taken together, this site is less a résumé and more a living logbook. A record of things built, ideas tested, and directions explored—still incomplete, still evolving. Feel free to wander.
